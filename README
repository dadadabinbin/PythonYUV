It run in a interactive mode. First it asks for a command line, and then parse and execute it.
Avalable commands:

  "h"  :  There's not and help now
  "fd" :  Find the first different MB between the 2 YUV
  "q"  :  Quit the dead loop of asking for command and execute
  "nd" :  Find the first different MB in specified frame, a FrameNum should follow the "nd" command
  "nc" :  Stands for "no command"


### Future plan {{{1

extend the no-interactive mode with the ablity to print All MBs of a YUV.
add other useful functionality to both interactive and no-interactive mode.
